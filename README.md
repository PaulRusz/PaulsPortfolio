Paul's Personal Portfolio

## Description

The website is my own personal portfolio.  The purpose of the website is to showcase my projects and assignments from my coding bootcamp while also provide a space for me to reference in the future should I need to.

I built the website so that I would be able to show exactly what I am capable of creating and to look back on should I need help with any future projects.

While creating my portfolio I learned how to build a website (mostly) from scratch.  I also dived deeper into utilyzing CSS to format my webpage the way I'd like prospective companies or clients to view me.
